# Plant Disease Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect diseases in plants using images of leaves. The goal is to classify plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories to help farmers and researchers monitor plant health efficiently.

## 30% Milestone Work Completed
So far, the following work has been completed:

1. Data Collection
    Dataset collected from [PlantVillage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) (full dataset is large).
    Only a small sample of images is uploaded here to demonstrate folder structure.

2. Data Preprocessing
    Images are organized into class folders.
    Implemented preprocessing.py script to:
    Split dataset into `train`, `val`, and `test` sets.
    Preserve folder structure for further model training.
   Folder structure after preprocessing:
